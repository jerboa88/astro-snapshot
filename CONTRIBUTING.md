## Development Workflow

### Local Testing

To test your changes in a local Astro project:

1. Build the integration:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. Link the package locally:
   ```bash
   npm link
   ```

3. In your test Astro project:
   ```bash
   npm link astro-snapshot
   ```

4. Configure and test the integration in your Astro project

### Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run type-check
```

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Add TSDoc comments for public APIs
- Follow the existing code style
- Ensure your code passes linting:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```
